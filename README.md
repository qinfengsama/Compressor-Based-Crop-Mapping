### Ours
As an example, use the following command to run our method on four parcel.
~~~
cd model/

python ours_admin.py
~~~

### Deep learning models
#### TempCNN, LSTM and InceptionTime
~~~
cd model/TempCNN_LSTM_InceptionTime/

python tempcnn.py \
--areas t30uxv \
--train_num 0.2 \
--period 43 \
--model "Choose the model from TempCNN, LSTM, or InceptionTime."
